They produce several reality TV shows, enjoy phenomenal amounts of money, and are arguably two of the most powerful people in television. Yet with so many similarities, one can't help but wonder who is the more successful of the two.</p><h2 id=how-ryan-seacrest-became-famous><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How Ryan Seacrest Became Famous</span></h2><p>Ryan Seacrest first became a television host in the 1990s. He started as the host of Radical Outdoor Challenge, as well as several game shows, including Gladiators 2000, the spin-off of American Gladiators. He also hosted NBC Saturday Night. However, it would be the sensation that was American Idol that made Seacrest a star. Seacrest became synonymous with the identity of the show, and thus a reality TV star was born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-andy-cohen-became-famous><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Andy Cohen Became Famous</span></h2><p>Cohen has experience hosting radio shows, but his rise to fame was a little different from Seacrest's. Before he was producing shows, he was a high-ranking executive for the Bravo network. He was their executive vice president of development and talent, a position he stayed in until 2013. Before that, he was the producer of The Early Show. Throughout the 2000s he grew to prominence as a guest on shows like Today and Morning Joe. He skyrocketed to fame thanks to his involvement with shows like Top Chef, Project Runway, and of course TheReal Housewives franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-seacrest-and-cohen-have-hosted-several-shows><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Both Seacrest And Cohen Have Hosted Several Shows</span></h2><p>With their rise to fame, Seacrest and Cohen began to branch out. In addition to American Idol, Seacrest became the host of Dick Clark's New Years Rocking Eve after the famous Rock N Roll TV host died. He also got contracts with E! and NBC. Cohen launched the SiriusXM network, Radio Andy, in 2015. He also hosted multiple Miss USA pageants and did a two-man show with CNN's Anderson Cooper, AC2. Seacrest also went into radio and became the host of America's Top 40, replacing Casey Kasem, another iconic host like Dick Clark. Ever since 2017, Seacrest has been the cohost of Live With Ryan and Kelly replacing Michael Strahan. He is also a regular contributor on The Today Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-has-more-awards><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Has More Awards?</span></h2><p>Seacrest has collected 3 Emmys over the course of his career, ironically not one of them was for American Idol. Cohen however only has one Emmy but he also has several other awards. He has a Peabody award for his documentary The N Word and another for Project Runway, <a href=#>a GLAAD Media award, </a>and his three memoirs, Superficial, Most Talkative, and The Andy Cohen Diaries are all best sellers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Andy Cohen Accidentally Spilled A Secret About Beverly Hills Housewife Kyle Richards</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-seacrest-39-s-shows><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ryan Seacrest's Shows</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, Seacrest branched out from his hosting duties and into producing. Ryan Seacrest Productions launched in 2008 and became a powerhouse with shows like Keeping Up With The Kardashians and its various spin-offs, Melissa and Tye, and Shahs Of Sunset. Seacrest's production company has found itself in a few public controversies. He was accused of sabotaging the efforts to the Shahs of Sunset crew to unionize, and he was accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 by a former E! employee.</p><h2 id=andy-cohen-39-s-shows><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Andy Cohen's Shows</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cohen produced Top Chef, which won him his Emmy, and Watch What Happens Live! But his Real Housewives franchise is arguably his most successful as it has several spin-offs and international versions. There are also the many radio shows on Radio Andy. He also became the host of the reboot of the classic game show Love Connection.</p><h2 id=ryan-seacrest-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ryan Seacrest's Net Worth</span></h2><p>Seacrest is now approximately worth <a href=#>$450 million</a> thanks to his many business ventures. In addition to everything already mentioned, he has collaborated on a clothing line with Randa Apparel and Accessories, is the principal investor of the TYPO keyboard for iPhone, and both Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners have invested millions in Ryan Seacrest Media. Ryan Seacrest Productions also signed a contract with ABC Studios where they will develop several scripted shows, so Seacrest has expanded out of reality TV and into scripted ventures now too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why Ryan Seacrest's Foundation Doesn't Seem So Charitable</a></span></p><h2 id=andy-cohen-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Andy Cohen's Net Worth</span></h2><p>Cohen's network is significantly lower than Ryan Seacrest's but is still incredibly large. <a href=#>Cohen is worth $50 million</a> thanks to his many shows, his three best-selling memoirs, and he has a rather large filmography. He has played himself in many shows and films, including Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Inside Amy Schumer. He also had a cameo in an episode of Sex and The City in 2004. Cohen has been recognized by several publications as one of the most successful LGBTQ business executives in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-who-is-more-successful><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>So, Who Is More Successful?</span></h2><p>The answer to the question, who is more successful, depends on how one defines success. As far as net worth goes, Seacrest has Cohen beat by several hundreds of millions of dollars. Whereas when it comes to award recognition, Cohen definitely has him beat. Cohen also has more shows on the air, thanks to Real Housewives, while Seacrest has worked on more television shows as a host. So who is the more successful is really a question for their fans to decide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5ypYrCwtMSnZK%2BrXafGorqMrJyam6KawLV51qGmZqGjYsGpsYympqudXajCpK%2FErKqfrZxiv6aty6KrsmWkq3quu8auo2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
