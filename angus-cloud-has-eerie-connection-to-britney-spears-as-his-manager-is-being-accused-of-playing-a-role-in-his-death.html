I want you to know that is not the case,” she wrote. “I only know that he put his head on the desk where he was working on art project’s, fell asleep and didn’t wake up.”</p><p>“We may find out that he overdosed accidentally and tragically, but it’s abundantly clear that he did not intend to check out of this world,” she continued.
