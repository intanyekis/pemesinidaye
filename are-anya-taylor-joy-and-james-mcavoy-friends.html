God really has his favorites. When asked how it was like kissing James who was playing a guy with&nbsp;sixteen personalities, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anya told Conan</a>, "I don't think I had such a hard time in the scene, 'cause I mean, James."&nbsp;So ladies, chill, she's fully aware of how lucky she is.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Anya&nbsp;went on to say that it was probably more challenging for James to kiss her in his nine-year-old boy personality while her eyes were wide open. She said&nbsp;the actor handled it very well, though. Okay, Anya, we get it.&nbsp; He must have been a really good kisser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anya Taylor-Joy Explains Why Beth Has Red Hair On ‘The Queen’s Gambit’</a></span></p><h2 id=they-make-memes-of-each-other-as-a-prank>They Make Memes Of Each Other As A Prank</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Anya revealed that when she and James started working with each other, they would make memes of each other as a prank. Her favorite thing to do was to post pictures of&nbsp;James as Mr. Tumnus in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>&nbsp;inside of his room. How adorable, right? Definitely friendship goals. Now, we're just as curious as you are about the other pranks they've pulled on one another.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Spanish-Speaking Anya Taylor-Joy Learned English</a></span></p><h2 id=they-work-so-well-together-onscreen>They Work So Well Together Onscreen</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Anya and James deliver&nbsp;amazing&nbsp;onscreen performances. They have great chemistry that will make you&nbsp;glue your eyes on the screen when they're in a scene together. It probably comes from their fun friendship behind the scenes.&nbsp;Pranking each other is a good way to bond, after all. We just wish they'd work on more projects together. Maybe a rom-com for a change.
