In other words: the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">looser and breezier</a>, the better! We like to have room to breathe in our ensembles instead of rocking skintight pieces — not only because they feel lighter, but they’re almost always that much more comfortable.</p><p>That said, we prefer shopping for looser dresses which still maintain a structure. A basic T-shirt dress is ideal for more casual days, but if we want a more elevated look, sleek shirtdresses <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">like this one from Cupshe</a> are the right move! It offers up the ultimate in fun summery floral prints, plus the right style that we can tweak for any outing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CUPSHE-Womens-Floral-Shirt-Dress.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">CUPSHE Women’s Floral Shirt Dress</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$35</a> at Amazon!

With the buttons running down the front, you can also use this as a kimono to team over other dresses or ensembles you already own. With each of the four floral prints, introducing this as a lightweight layer will spice up any outfit!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CUPSHE-Womens-Floral-Shirt-Dress-2.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">CUPSHE Women’s Floral Shirt Dress</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$35</a> at Amazon!

We adore finding this type of versatility as it’s incredibly rare — especially at this price point. Reviewers also claim that the fit is “perfectly oversized,” and the fabric feels fabulous against the skin. Whether you decide to keep this on hold until the summertime or you find ways to wear it now, this shirtdress is a piece that’s bound to go the distance.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">CUPSHE Women’s Floral Shirt Dress</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$35</a> at Amazon!
