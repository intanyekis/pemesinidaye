For me, it was very cut and dried that I wasn't coming back." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, he did return as Bond in&nbsp;No Time to Die&nbsp;and confirmed that&nbsp;would&nbsp;be his last appearance as 007.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is Going to Be the Next James Bond?</h2><p>While discussing the&nbsp;new James Bond movie,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>No Time to Die</a>, producer Barbara Broccoli <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed to Variety</a> that fans should&nbsp;stop spreading false rumors.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She mentioned that&nbsp;the creators&nbsp;have not decided upon the next James Bond cast&nbsp;until "the dust has settled" on the Daniel Craig era. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It will have to be reimagined, in the way each actor has reimagined the role. That’s what is so exciting and fun about this franchise; the character evolves. Eventually, when we have to think about it, we’ll find the right person.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Broccoli did not specify the actor they were&nbsp;planning to cast, but she went on to reveal&nbsp;that the next person to fight against the bad guys can be non-white and non-British; he&nbsp;can be of any race or sexual orientation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Daniel Craig on the Next James Bond Being Female</h2><p>With the ongoing question amongst the fans about the next James Bond, many people want to see a woman in the 007 tuxedo.&nbsp;Many fans have speculated that Bond's new 00 agent&nbsp;Nomi, played by Lashana Lynch, will take hold of the franchise.&nbsp;</p><p>When Craig&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoke to Radio Times</a>, he was asked about his thoughts on casting a woman in the role of Bond. He said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The answer to that is very simple. There should simply be better parts for women and actors of color. Why should a woman play James Bond when there should be a part just as good as James Bond, but for a woman?</p><p>He, however, does think people of color should be offered the role, and women should have new characters written for them instead of just assigning a role previously played by a male actor.</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>No Time to Die</a>&nbsp;will be released&nbsp;on October 8, with the premiere taking place on September&nbsp;28 at London's Royal Albert Hall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRo7amuIycqZqhl2K7psTTZqGapZWoeqO7zZ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
