The home sits on 0.8 acres of land.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cardi B Denies Money Is The Reason She Didn’t Divorce Offset</a></span></p><p>Some of the home’s outdoor features include ample palm trees, a firepit lounge, sports court, standalone pizza oven, a stone fountain, and a garage with space for 8 cars.</p><p>Dr. Dre hasn’t owned the home for very long. He originally purchased it in 2018 for $5 million, so he only made a $1 million profit from the sale.</p><p>It’s possible that Dr. Dre’s reason for selling the Calabasas abode is to upgrade to something even more luxurious. This is highly likely, given that he’s about to come into a lot of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this was never Dr. Dre’s permanent residence. He currently owns another property in Calabasas as well as a $40 million estate in Brentwood that he previously purchased from Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen.</p><p>He's also got another property on the market currently – his Malibu vacation home, <a href=#>which he’s seeking $20 million for</a>.</p><p>It was first reported the home was on the market in late November. With a view of Carbon Beach, the home has 8,800 square feet of living space, including 6 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He originally acquired the property in 2000 for $4 million, so if it sells at the asking price, Dr. Dre will make a considerable profit.</p><p>But nothing compares to the deals he’s reportedly negotiating over his music rights. Earlier this month, it was reported that he’s close to finalizing two separate deals – one with Universal Music, and another with Shamrock Holdings – which together total around $200 million in profits.</p><p>Dr. Dre won’t be selling his entire music catalog, however, rather only a selection of some of his biggest hits and albums. This means he’ll still be able to make a passive income on the music he retains the rights to.</p><p>$200 million will certainly pad Dr. Dre’s net worth, but he’s already estimated to be worth anywhere between $500 million to $850 million, largely thanks to his brands and work in music production in addition to his own solo career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Twitter Will Suffer If Elon Musk Won’t Make Debt Payment</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a>, <a href=#>AD</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmadql2Zv6Z5y6KinqSpYsKxs9Gam6Kml2Kup8DEq2SsnZyhtq%2BzjG9kpqGcobawuoycmKWZkpbAor%2BMoaamnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
