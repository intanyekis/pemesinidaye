Agreed! OK, need to have twenty five characters-this should do it.
Since I’ve become available, I would give anything to have a man call me &#34;Sweetness.’ I’m a great fan of the terms of endearment on DAYS. There’s Patch’s “Sweetness” for Kayla, Bo’s “Fancy Face” for Hope, and &#34;John’s “Doc” for Marlena. Are there any other TOD that I may had missed or forgotten?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She still loves him. I just know they are on the road to reconciliation. Kayla is hurt, and she’s puzzled and questioning Steve’s change of heart and location. Time will heal. Steve has tremendous powers of persuasion where Kayla is concerned, and she is drawn to him.</p><p>While I was never particularly a fan of Fancy Face, I always like Steve referring to Kayla as Sweetness. It’s just Steve. And for the record, I think he looks great! I like just looking at him…but I have also really enjoyed his oh-so natural acting and gruff charm…mm mm mm.</p><p>It does sound stupid when the wife is mad at him. For some reason I don’t mind Bo’s pet name for Hope, but I don’t like Patch’s. When Stephen played Stefan on GH, he called Laura “Lasha”, and that drove me insane. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png title=:laughing: alt=:laughing: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>L_Glass</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>September 9, 2015, 5:51pm <span itemprop=position>12</span></span><p>Ugg and Bo’s first sentence includes “Fancy Face”</p><p>ITA with the posters who give favorable feedback regarding the pet names/terms of endearment. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> It all really does coincide with their characters. Marlena is a Doctor; Kayla has always been a good, sweet woman; Hope is beautiful and came from a privileged family. Also, Bo and Shawn D named their boats “Fancy Face” to honor Hope. I “get” Hope calling Bo “Brady” bc cops use their last names.<br>I’m actually sick of the unrefined, platitudinous term “baby” many couples these days use. For some reason, I cringe when Aiden and Daniel call their women “baby” (especially Daniel). Daniel also calls Nicole “legs” which I find vapid. I think “Angel” would be good bc she has a pretty face and looks like she could be Victoria’s Secret Angels model. Also, it would be an ironic for Nicole. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png title=:laughing: alt=:laughing: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><img alt width=20 height=20 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/dbc845/40.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> daysforever:<p>Since I’ve become available, I would give anything to have a man call me "Sweetness.’ I’m a great fan of the terms of endearment on DAYS.

Loved that!</p><p>If Xander had stayed around long enough and not been such a criminal, I bet he would’ve come up with a totally awesome nickname for Nicole said in HIS to die for Scottish accent. Alas, it was not to be. Sigh.</p><p>When Daniel calls Nicole legs I want to hurl.
