She said that Rosie told her, “Girl, you know, I just wanted you to know that you needed to be quiet. I thought you were gonna go on too long. You know, we have a system here and we know when the other one is about to talk. So I just wanted to stop you from talking too much.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Naturally, Garcelle seemed taken aback by the way that Rosie tried to communicate with her. “What kind of system is that where grown women kick each other like f**king mules?” she questioned. The reality star admitted to having a less than ideal time during her test run, and she didn’t really feel welcomed. “The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>energy was cold,</a> unfriendly and standoffish,” she wrote. “The atmosphere was so opposite to my friendly nature and definitely not what I had expected or hoped for.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Garcelle-Beauvais-Rosie-Perez-View-Audition-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rosie wasn’t the only&nbsp;View&nbsp;co-host that Garcelle had a less-than-admirable opinion of. She also revealed that she didn’t have a good impression of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> </a>at the time. “I was shocked and appalled to see how testy Whoopi was with the show’s producers,” she wrote. “I was embarrassed and disappointed, to say the least. It was cringeworthy!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite a bad first impression, Garcelle admitted that she didn’t hold <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>any hard feeling</a>s towards the award-winning moderator in an interview with&nbsp;Page Six. “I got reintroduced to Whoopi, and I think sometimes you don’t get a second chance like that. Sometimes you have to be open for a reintroduction,” she explained. “I told her because I didn’t want to go into the film like I was bamboozling her. That’s not my thing. So it was important that she knew that was in my book.&nbsp;We’re all good now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49vZqCZopiyrbjEZpmemaWrrqq%2FjKumrKGVYr2mvsSzZK2glWLDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
