Inspired by the party’s theme, Steinfeld wore a pink-and-blue striped button-up shirt over a matching tank, which she paired with jeans and white sneakers.</p><p>The couple’s sex reveal guess was the same as Allen’s parents, <strong>Joel</strong> and <strong>LaVonne</strong>, and his younger brother, Jason, and Nicala. (Allen’s younger sister, Makenna, was not featured in the TikTok post.)</p><p>Their suspicions were correct, as Nicala’s TikTok ended with a clip of her and Brayden releasing pink and blue balloons, with the pink ones floating away to leave only the blue balloons.</p><p>“Blessed to love on another baby boy 🥹💙,” she captioned her TikTok. “Kashtyn is going to make the best big brother ever. We love our boys so much and can’t wait for little brother to arrive in September 🥹.” (Nicala and Brayden welcomed their son Kashtyn, 12 months, in March 2023.)</p><a title=@nicalamadden href=#>@nicalamadden</a><p>Blessed to love on another baby boy 🥹💙 Kashtyn is going to make the best big brother ever.

After a handful of more dates, a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in June 2023 that their relationship was “going really great.” The insider added, “[They] laugh a ton when they’re together [and] are always smiling.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Allen <a href=#>addressed their relationship</a> for the first time when asked about his reaction to seeing published photos of himself and Steinfeld kissing on vacation. “The fact that anybody cares about that still blows my mind,” he told the “Pardon My Take” <a href=# rel=noopener>podcast</a> in August 2023.</p><p>Steinfeld has made several appearances with Allen and his family over the past few months, including<a href=#> shopping with his mother</a> and supporting him at an October 2023 <a href=#>Buffalo Bills game</a>. That same month, she and the quarterback also <a href=#>attended an NHL game</a> between the Buffalo Sabres and the New York Rangers.</p><p>Allen’s teammate <strong>Dion Dawkins</strong> offered some insight into their relationship earlier this month. “Josh is in love. And if his girl is shopping and she’s like, ‘Josh, try these on,’ Josh is going to say, ‘Alright. I’ll try these on,” he shared while discussing Allen’s ripped pants moment on the March 12 episode of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Up & Adams Show With Kay Adams</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZmhsqZ50q2coqaWmrmlecmooKerXZ%2B8tLSMmqOlnZ5irrV5x6KqZqiimrSvrc2tZKyho6mys7%2BMrJyxZaKaw6aty2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
