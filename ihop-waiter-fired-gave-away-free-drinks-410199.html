A waiter employed at an IHOP in Brooklyn, NY, was arrested and charged with felony grand larceny and possession of stolen property for giving away up to $3,000 in drinks. William Powell was fired and later released from jail on his own recognizance on Mar. 2, The New York Daily News reports.
He didn’t believe free soda was a crime because he was helping customers who couldn’t afford a beverage with their meals."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I take from the rich and give to the poor. What’s the big deal? I’ve been doing this since I started here. I am the modern-day Robin Hood.”</p><p>The big deal, to IHOP, was the low amount of drinks the former waiter was actually selling. Powell’s orders showed 6 percent of beverages compared to his co-workers rates of 20 percent.</p><p>“I kind of told them, ‘This is not supposed to happen, but here you guys go,’” he said. Despite losing his job, Powell said he will find another job in the restaurant industry because he loves being a waiter.</p><p>Whatever makes you happy, dear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX561sLyMsJiirJWneqe10Z6bZp%2BRq7JurdaasGaeopqybrDRoqWkq11pfnF9mHJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
