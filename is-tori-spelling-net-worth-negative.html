Over the years, she has had various gigs in reality TV and various media, but fans have remained glued to the drama of her personal life.</p><p>From her lackluster inheritance to wasting millions of dollars, by her own admission, to struggling with her marriage, onlookers could only assume Tori Spelling's life wasn't getting any easier over time. So in 2023, when paparazzi spotted Tori Spelling living in an RV, fans wondered just how far she had fallen. Is Tori Spelling's net worth negative today, and what happened to all the money she inherited and earned?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tori-spelling-39-s-family-once-had-hundreds-of-millions>Tori Spelling's Family Once Had Hundreds Of Millions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aaron-spelling-tori-spelling-toni-webb.jpg><p>Tori Spelling originally grew to fame thanks to her family's proximity to the Hollywood industry. Her late father, Aaron Spelling, was a rich and well-known TV producer who was worth around $400 million when he died.</p><p>But <a href=# rel=nofollow>what happened to the family money</a>? It largely went to Aaron's wife, Candy. While Tori's mom apparently helped her financially for a time, ultimately, a rumored long-standing feud with her daughter may have impacted how the money was shared.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Was Dean McDermott's Net Worth Higher Before Marrying Tori Spelling?</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Tori Spelling's net worth seemed to peak around a few million dollars, but it has also fluctuated over the years.

For the average person, that might sound like a lot, but for Tori, who came from a super-rich family, it likely wasn't much.</p><p>Unfortunately for the couple, their net worth wouldn't stick, and amid divorce rumors that spanned years, it seemed finances would only get worse.</p><h2 id=is-tori-spelling-39-s-net-worth-negative>Is Tori Spelling's Net Worth Negative?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-2023-06-23t150049-487.jpg><p>It was once hinted that Aaron Spelling purposely left his kids less than $1M each upon his passing to teach them a financial lesson. It was widely reported that Tori Spelling overspent beyond her (well, her father's) means for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she received her inheritance, it seemed that Spelling didn't use it wisely. Over the years, various outlets reported on Tori Spelling's financial issues, namely the fact that she owed taxes to the IRS.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tori Spelling Was Accused Of Overreacting Amid Health Issues That Landed Her In The Hospital</a></span></p><p>One tax lien was lodged for only a few hundred dollars in 2022, but that small charge was only a drop in the bucket.

The statement, which stuck to facts, announced that he and Tori were going their separate ways.</p><p>However, according to multiple sources, Dean had already moved out of the former family home in advance of the announcement. As such, when Tori was spotted staying at a motel with their five kids, she told reporters that it was to protect her family from unsafe mold conditions at home.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Everything Tori Spelling Has Said About Her Marriage To Dean McDermott</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources hinted that given the apparently sorry state of Tori's credit, she couldn't manage to find a better place to stay. It's unclear whether she can't afford a rental or is having trouble finding a reasonable place; at this point, it's clear that Tori cannot afford typical Hollywood prices for a rental.</p><p>After leaving the motel, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tori and her kids were spotted staying in an RV</a> in Ventura County, but it is unclear whether that was a semi-permanent solution or where the RV was purchased, rented, or borrowed.</p><p>Because of her years of alleged overspending, it might be that Tori Spelling is unfortunately out of options when it comes to providing housing for her kids. Plus, given Dean McDermott's relative lack of projects (he used to act more frequently), it's unclear whether either party would be on the hook for any amount of child support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet that didn't stop Dean's ex-wife from suing him for back child support in 2017; at the time, Mary Jo Eustace claimed that Dean and Tori lived in a $2 million home owned by Candy. Sadly for Tori, it doesn't seem that her mom was willing to help the family relocate due to mold issues in what is apparently her home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWkpL%2BqedKpnKWkmaO0brrErWSwp6KptW66xKCYraGmmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
