But we like Goff. I like where he’s at. He finished strong. Keep adding pieces and then whenever that is (to add a quarterback), is it next year? Is it this year? Is it two years from now? And the right guy is sitting there, then you figure out a way to get that guy when it’s the right guy,” the second-year coach said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Goff readies to throw a pass during a Lions-Broncos game in December 2021 <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Pittsburgh’s Kenny Pickett, Liberty’s Malik Willis and Sam Howell of North Carolina are among the notable signal-callers in this year’s draft class.
