Jeffrey Dahmer was a serial killer cannibal who targeted homosexual men and teens, many of whom were people of color.</p><p>Dahmer usually killed people in public places like bars, bus stops, and the street. He got them to come back to his apartment by offering money for photos or sex. When the men went to Dahmer’s house, he would give them drugs, kill them, and often cut up their bodies and have sex with them.</p><p>The New York Times said Jeffrey Dahmer kept trophies of his victims and put their bones in a 57-gallon drum. Here’s everything you need to know about Dahmer and the 17 innocent people he killed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Were The Victims Of Jeffrey Dahmer?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Steven Hicks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-148.png><p>18-year-old <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Steven Hicks</a> was murdered in 1978 after Jeffrey Dahmer picked him up in Ohio. Steven was hitchhiking to get to a rock show with his friends. Steven was taken back to his dad’s house by Jeffrey Dahmer, who gave him a beer. In the Netflix show, the guys are shown lifting weights and drinking beer, but when Steve’s friends are coming over, Jeffrey doesn’t want Steve to leave.</p><p>When Steven tried to leave, Jeffrey used a dumbbell to hit him over the head. He then strangled him, cut him up, and spread his body parts in the woods behind his family home.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Steven Tuomi</h3><p>Between 1978 and 1987, Jeffrey Dahmer did not kill anyone. Steven Tuomi, who was thought to be 24 or 25 years old, was the second person he killed. In September 1987, Jeffrey and Steven met at a bar. Jeffrey told the police that he had drugged and raped Steven after taking him back to a hotel in Milwaukee, but he said he couldn’t remember what happened after that.</p><p>Jeffrey Dahmer said that when he woke up, Steven was dead in his bed and that he “had no plans to hurt him.” Dahmer supposedly took Steven’s body in a suitcase to his grandmother’s house, where he broke it up and crushed the bones.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>James Doxtator</h3><p>James Doxator met Jeffrey Dahmer when he was only 14 years old. Jeffrey got James to go down to the basement of his grandmother’s house by telling him he would pay him for naked pictures. He then gave James drugs, raped him, strangled him, and cut up his body.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Richard Guerrero</h3><p>Jeffrey Dahmer told Richard Guerrero that he would pay him if he went back to his grandmother’s house with him. Jeffery then drugged and strangled Richard, committed necrophilia, and dismembered Richard’s body after.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Anthony Sears</h3><p>Anthony, a model who was 24 years old, met Jeffrey Dahmer in a bar. Jeffrey Dahmer drugged and strangled Anthony, but he is also said to have kept things that reminded him of the killing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Raymond Smith</h3><p>Jeffrey Dahmer’s first murder after getting out of prison for a second-degree sexual assault charge was the killing of Raymond Smith. Jeffery got a new apartment and stopped living with his grandmother. Not long after that, he met Raymond Smith, a 32-year-old s*x worker.</p><p>Jeffrey gave Raymond drugs, strangled him, and then took pictures of the dead man’s body. He also cut Raymond’s body into pieces and saved his head, which he kept near the remains of Anthony Sears. In 1991, the photos and the remains were finally found.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Edward Smith</h3><p>Edward Smith was the seventh person Jeffrey Dahmer killed. It was said that the 27-year-old and Jeffrey Dahmer had been seen at a club together before.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ernest Miller</h3><p>Ernest Miller was a busboy in 1990 when he went to Milwaukee to see his family over Labor Day weekend. When they met, Dahmer gave him money to go back to his apartment. In a 1991 article from the Washington Post, it says that Dahmer drugged Ernest and then killed him by cutting his throat.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>David Thomas</h3><p>In 1990, David Thomas, a young man, went missing. Jeffrey Dahmer was found guilty of killing him, and photos of his body after it had been cut up were found, but his body has never been found. David is one of the four people whose bodies have not been found. The other three are Steve Tuomi, Richard Guerrero, and Eddie Smith.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Curtis Straughter</h3><p>Jeffrey Dahmer killed Curtis Straughter. He was the tenth person he killed. Curtis was at a bus stop near Marquette University when Dahmer came up to him. Curtis went back to his apartment because Dahmer offered him money in exchange for sending him photos. Curtis was given drugs, strangled, and cut up by Dahmer when he went back with him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Errol Lindsey</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-149.png><p>Errol Lindsey, who was 19 years old at the time, met Jeffrey Dahmer on the street. Dahmer’s friends told him to go back to Dahmer’s apartment. Errol was given drugs when he went back, but his case is different because he was the first person Dahmer tried to experiment on.</p><p>Errol Lindsey had a hole drilled in his head, and Dahmer poured acid into it to make him act like a zombie. Errol Lindsey woke up, but Dahmer gave him more drugs, strangled him, and then took his body apart and threw it away.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tony Hughes</h3><p>At a gay bar, Tony Hughes and Jeffrey Dahmer met each other. Tony wanted to be a model, but he couldn’t hear. They wrote notes to each other to talk. Tony Hughes was strangled by Dahmer, and his body was on the floor for three days before he cut it up and took pictures of it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Konerak Sinthasomphone</h3><p>Jeffrey Dahmer lured Konerak Sinthasomphone back to his apartment while Tony Hughes’s body was still on the floor. Konerak was only 14 years old at the time. Dahmer drilled a hole in Konerak’s skull, but he woke up, got away, and started yelling for help.</p><p>As shown in the Netflix show, Glenda Cleveland lived in the building across the street from Dahmer and had already started to worry about him. As soon as she saw Konerak, she called the police. When Dahmer went back to talk to the boy, he was able to convince the police that the boy was actually 19 and his boyfriend. The police then let Dahmer bring the boy back inside, where he was killed right away. Dahmer took his body parts and put them in the freezer, but he kept his head.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matt Turner</h2><p>In the summer of 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer went to Chicago’s Pride Parade. There, he met Matt Turner, who was 20 years old. When they got to the bus station, Dahmer offered Matt Turner money to go to Milwaukee with him and pose for naked pictures. The Post said that when they got to Dahmer’s apartment, he drugged Turner and then strangled and cut him up.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Jeremiah Weinberger</h3><p>Just a few days after killing Matt Turner, Dahmer went back to Chicago and met Jeremiah at a gay bar. Jeremiah Weinberger, who was 23 years old at the time, was given money by Dahmer in exchange for going home with him to Milwaukee to trade naked photos. He stayed with Dahmer for two full days, according to reports. On the first day, they had oral sex, and the next day, when Jeremiah tried to leave, Dahmer strangled him and cut up his body.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Oliver Lacy</h3><p>In July 1991, Dahmer met Oliver Lacy, a 24-year-old man from Chicago. They met on a street corner in Milwaukee, and Dahmer asked him to come back to his apartment. Oliver went to Dahmer’s apartment and had a drink that Dahmer had put drugs in. After that, Oliver was killed.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Joseph Bredehoft</h3><p>Jeffrey Dahmer killed Joseph Bradehoft, who was 25 years old. He was the last person Dahmer killed. Joseph was a father of three from Minnesota who went to Milwaukee to look for work. Joseph’s body was on Dahmer’s bed for two days before he was cut in half, his head put in the fridge, and his body put in a drum.</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Real Life Apartment Once Owned By Jeffrey Dahmer Pictures: Where He Kill His Victims</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#>Tony Hughes And Jeffrey Dahmer Relationship Before He Murdered By Jeffrey Dahmer?</a></li><li><a href=#>Who Is Jeffrey Dahmer’s Step-mother Shari?
