She worked tirelessly to bring people together, promote civic pride, and economic development.</p><p>Johnette celebrated the arts with a great deal of passion. She worked with local artists to install public art in downtown spaces and enthusiastically supported local entrepreneurs, makers, creators, musicians, and business owners. Outside of the office, she was known by her friends and coworkers for her quirky costumes, spontaneous dance parties, and love of pigs in a blanket.</p><p>Although Johnette retired from her role at Realize Bradenton in October of 2022, she continued to support the community through her new, self-proclaimed role as Bradenton’s Biggest Cheerleader.</p><p>We will remember her for her countless big ideas, limitless enthusiasm, and the positive influence she had on our community.
