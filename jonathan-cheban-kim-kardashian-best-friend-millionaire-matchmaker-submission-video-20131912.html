Cheban, an entrepreneur, values his net worth at $5 million and added, “I definitely live a different lifestyle than other people.”</p><p>“My celebrity crush is Kim Kardashian,” he said of his BFF, with whom he is frequently photographed. “I love her butt, it’s kind of amazing,” he added of <a href=#>her famous curves</a>. “Because of her, I’ve changed the kind of girls that I like,” he said of <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>‘s fiancee. “They definitely need to be a little bit curvy — I used to like models, and now, actually, I can’t even look at models to be honest. I just think they’re so plain and so like, stick figure.”</p><p>(Back in March 2012, Cheban memorably got <a href=#>into a feud</a> of sorts with <strong><a href=#>Jon Hamm</a></strong>, after the Mad Men star ranted to a magazine, “Whether it’s Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated.”)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Everyone thinks Jonathan is gay,” said Stanger, 52, in a separate clip after meeting with him over a meal. “Hello, he’s straight!” Kim K’s bestie reached out to Stanger because he needed her help in finding someone special. “It’s time for me to start getting ready,” he said to the professional matchmaker. “My mom is dying for me to have kids, my dad passed away two years ago.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the millionaire shared his need for “somebody that can kind of, like, roll with the punches.” The Spin Crowd star added, “I get bored very easily with people.” One quality Cheban looks for in a lady? “She needs to be funny. I love a good audience, so I need a good laugher,” he said in the confessional, right before he rattled off an extensive list of turn-offs: “Pretty much 99 percent of anything,” he confessed, citing “annoying” people, those who take “forever to get ready,” “liars,” “social climbers,” and “ugly girls” as qualities he cannot stand.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Just because of the lifestyle I’m in, they need to look good,” demanded the fashion-forward reality star. And Louboutins are out in Cheban’s book. “I don’t want to see the red bottoms,” he said. “They need to be ahead of the curve, not some cheese ball wearing Steve Maddens.”</p><p>“I need a perfect ten!” he pleaded to Stanger in the final seconds of the clip. “I’m begging you to find me somebody special.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoppGptaK6jJyfnpqRo3qstcxmopqqlJbAqbXAp2SbnaOpeqe%2ByJ6lnWWdnrmttc6nmKKqlWK6osDCoaSao5WnerTBwaagrKuZpLtuwsidnKhlYmV%2BdH2Yamlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
