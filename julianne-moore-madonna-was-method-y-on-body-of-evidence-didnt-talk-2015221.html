The women both starred in Body of Evidence — an oft-mocked erotic thriller from 1993 — but as the Oscar-nominated actress puts it, Madge wanted nothing to do with her while filming.</p><p>During Watch What Happens Live, the Still Alice star was asked whether she was scared about slapping Madonna during one of their scenes. In a word: Yes.</p><p>“I was actually super nervous. I was so so nervous,” Moore, 54, told host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> and fellow guest <strong>Jonathan Groff</strong> on Wednesday, Jan. 21. “I actually didn’t even make contact.”</p><p>But that wasn’t the only reason why she was uncomfortable on set. Much to the amusement and shock of Cohen, Moore revealed that Madonna really, really got into her character Rebecca Carlson — a kinky lady accused of intentionally killing her rich, older, heart-diseased lover during sex — while shooting the Basic Instinct-esque flick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“It was a fake slap, but she wasn’t talking to me because she was being very method-y,” Moore added of Madonna, 56, whose filmography is littered with less-than-celebrated performances. “I felt nervous and scared. I didn’t want to hit her at all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She explained: “She was playing the girlfriend and I was playing the wife and we were supposed to be enemies.”</p><p>Moore may have been iced out, but it was nothing but steamy on set when she worked with The Affair’s <strong>Dominic West</strong> in 2004’s The Forgotten. While playing Plead the Fifth, Moore admitted that the hunky actor is the best on-screen smooch she’s ever had. “He’s an amazing kisser!” she gushed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyerq%2B6xGakqKeimnqurcOopaeZXayutHnMnquhp5Rixm67zWaZqJypYrynecSvoJ2dnpiybrDInaWtZaSWuax5kWlobmpiZnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
