The backlash was swift, and <a href=#>West took aim at one critic in particular</a> — Vogue editor <strong>Gabriella Karefa-Johnson</strong>, whom he mocked on social media for her own fashion choices.</p><p>Things only got messier in the following days, as West went on to share Instagram posts about his ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#>claiming that she and her family “kidnapped” their daughter Chicago</a> and refused to let him see her at her 4th birthday party, allegations he originally made earlier this year (and the Kardashians previously denied).</p><p><a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> stepped into the fray to beg her former brother-in-law to stop his rants, which only made the “Jesus Walks” artist double down on his comments even more.</p><p>On October 7, West sat down for a controversial interview on <strong>Tucker Carlson</strong>‘s Fox News show, during which he explained <a href=#>the reason why</a> he chose to wear the shirt emblazoned with “White Lives Matter” on the back.</p><p>“I do certain things from a feeling, I just channel the energy. It just feels right,” the designer explained. “It’s using a gut instinct, a connection with God and just brilliance.</p><p>He added: “People, they’re looking for an explanation, and people say, ‘Well, as an artist you don’t have to give an explanation,’ but as a leader, you do. So the answer to why I wrote ‘White Lives Matter’ on a shirt is because they do. It’s the obvious thing.”</p><p>The next day, after sharing an anti-semitic message via Instagram, the Chicago native’s account was restricted by Meta, Instagram’s parent company, for violating its rules and guidelines. His Twitter account was also temporarily locked.</p><p>“I burst into tears,” <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a> told <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> about seeing West’s remarks. “I woke up and burst into tears. Defcon 3 on Jewish people? What are you doing?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added, “It’s bad enough that fascism is on the rise around the world. But on Twitter, on a portal, to pour that in? As if Jewish people haven’t had it hard enough?”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about West’s Paris Fashion Week scandal, the aftermath and all the drama surrounding it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKK62J5ksJ2jqcBuw8eiq55lnJ7Dpr%2BMppitrJWneqW%2BwKaYZp2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlpKR6rLrOsGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
