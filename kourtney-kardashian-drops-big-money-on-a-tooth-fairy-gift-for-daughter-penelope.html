Kourtney documented the special occasion on Instagram, exclaiming, "The tooth fairy strikes again."</p><p>She unveiled a dazzling presentation of glitter, an $835 Prada soccer ball, $20, an Eloise book, and an adorable mushroom knick-knack as part of the surprise.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=#>Kevin Costner’s Ex-Wife Plans To “Enter The Workforce” After Losing Big In Divorce</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#>data from Colgate,</a> in 2018, the average tooth fairy payout was $3.70, marking a decrease of $0.43 from the previous year's figure of $4.13. Survey results reveal that roughly 2 out of every 5 parents confess to giving their children a minimum of $5 per lost tooth.</p><p>Needless to say, spending a grand on a tooth fairy gift is extravagant compared to the normal family, even by Kardashian standards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But as much as the reality television family is criticized for spoiling their offspring, they’ve also been <a href=#>accused of using their kids to make a profit,</a> like Kourtney’s sister Kim Kardashian recently was when traveling in Japan with her eldest daughter, 10-year old North West.</p><p>During the trip to Tokyo last month, Kim's Instagram feed primarily revolved around posts showcasing her eldest daughter, North. Keen-eyed followers were swift to observe the absence of her other three children – Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.</p><p>This observation raised questions about the rationale behind this discrepancy, sparking online discussions about the potential exploitation of North's image for financial purposes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>It even prompted a conversation on Reddit</a>, where a user expressed a sentiment shared by many, inquiring where Kim’s three other children were during her international trip.</p><p>"North is the oldest girl of Kim’s children, which makes her able to be... profitable now, hence why she posts her so much,” one person wrote in the Reddit thread. “She is trying to get a head start on marketing North’s 'brand' while she is still young..."</p><p>Considering reports indicating that Kim can earn up to $1 million for a single sponsored post, it's clear that she has the capacity to accumulate substantial income through her social media activity. Nevertheless, as of now, the reality star has not offered an explanation for the disparity in her social media coverage between her daughter North and her other children.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Beyonce Drops Over $20,000/Night To Rent Private Island For Wild Birthday Celebration</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qorKusnprGbrfAq5uaq5ierq95w6umqatdl7aoecyopZ6xXaS7bq2MraaorJhis6K10bJkoKGWqXqnu9Fmm5qtl53Bpr6MqZynnZykvaZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
