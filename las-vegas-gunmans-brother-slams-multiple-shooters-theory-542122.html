The gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday (Oct. 1) after he opened fire on attendees of the <a href=# id=auto-tag_route-91-harvest-festival_1 data-tag=route-91-harvest-festival>Route 91 Harvest Festival</a> from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Hotel. The shooting left 59 dead and 527 others&nbsp;injured.</p><p>Witness accounts claimed multiple shooters fired rounds towards the country music fans, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">conspiracy theorists</a> quickly hopping on. While it was revealed that the gunman used automatic rifles with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">bump stocks </a>to fire multiple rounds at once, it hasn’t done much to silence the theory.</p><p>Speaking about his brother, Paddock assured reporters that Stephen’s attack was a one-man crime.</p><p>“Of course Steve did this by himself,” he said. “He was highly intelligent and he could do anything he wanted to do. He gambled for 20+ years. He did it mathematically. He did cause it was a way to have a fun life. That may have changed. The hotels did that. Here’s the clue for the day.”</p><p>He also spoke highly of his brother’s gambling career after it was reported he wired girlfriend&nbsp;Marilou Danley $100,000.&nbsp;“Whoo $100,000 we’re wealthy people, it’s not that much money when you’re gambling,” he said. “I’m sorry if that offends people. I guess everyone thinks that everyone works at Taco Bell. If you’re going to condemn Steve for being a high stakes gambler, the casinos are going to have a problem with you. If these hotel say they don’t know Steve, they’re lying.”</p><p>Danley was met by FBI agents Tuesday when she returned to the states from the Philippines.&nbsp;“They’ve been to the Philippines multiple times. He’s loved Mary Lou. Even if they broke up, he wouldn’t have told me,” he added.</p><p>Information on Stephen Paddock in the internet space essentially doesn’t exist, Eric told reporters. “He was a private guy. That’s why you can’t find out anything about him. Is he a weirdo for not having a Facebook and posting 50,000 pictures of himself everyday?”</p><p>If anything, Eric’s interview raised more questions than answers about the domestic terrorist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6GutHnVnp6aq12cwq%2B5wKeqZpqipMGpsdFmqqWZnah6rsHLraCppJViwKm7zq2cq6tdqbWmu9GyZG5sYmZ%2Fc3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
