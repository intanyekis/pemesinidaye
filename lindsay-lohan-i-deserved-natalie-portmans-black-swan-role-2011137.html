"Monday morning was supposed to be check-out time, but Lindsay and her posse refused to leave," Powers writes. "It was like watching the lights come on at a nightclub after-hours — not pretty."</p><p>The most annoying part, Powers tells <a href=#>Gawker</a>, is that "Plum covered all Lindsay's expenses, including airfare for her and her family/entourage, lodging at the iconic Raleigh hotel in the penthouse suite and all transportation costs."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOippSorrp5y6ifmqZdnnqlsdKeqa%2BdlGK7osDApaCeZaCkv7W5wKeqZpqclrCsedKwmKdloqS5pnmRaWhqaWNsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
