The show follows the lives of the Roloffs, a family who owns a farm close to Portland, Oregon and follows them as they navigate new challenges that come their way.</p><p>The hit show has come a long way since its beginning and so have all the cast members. While some members of the family have fallen off the radar, others are still constantly making headlines, such as <a href=#>Zach and his family</a>. In general, <strong>owning a farm implies that loads of money is probably coming your way regularly, and that was the case of the Roloffs. </strong>That, added to money made from the show, has made the cast members significantly well-to-do.</p><p>Here are Little People, Big World cast members ranked by their net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated February 2024: </strong>There have not been any changes to the net worths of any of the cast of Little People, Big World. However, there will be big changes to Amy Roloff's net worth at some point down the line, after Matt Roloff announced that he was going to be leaving the farm to her when he dies. Zach Roloff and his wife, Tori, announced that they are exiting the series, a show that Zach has been on for 25 seasons.</p><h2 id=matt-roloff><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Matt Roloff</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-6-million>Net Worth: $6 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/matt-roloff-little-people-big-world.jpg><ul><li><strong>Matt will be appearing in Season 25 of Little People, Big World</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the fact that he ran a successful farm with his ex-wife Amy, Matt Roloff is also credited as a business entrepreneur, author, and television personality. <strong>A large part of Matt’s money came from his farm</strong>, which led him to explore other business ventures (most of which were initially tied to his ex-wife), but things changed after their relationship crumbled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after Matt and Amy officially got divorced, Matt and a formal farm official, Caryn Chandler, confirmed that they were dating via social media.

However, <strong>she still has stakes in the property and earns money from it</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, she also earns money from the books she has authored, one of which is her book Short and Simple Fall Recipes. <strong>Things are going pretty well for Amy right now as she recently found love again and got married to Chris Marek</strong>.</p><p>Amy is generally a successful woman and has her net worth at an estimated at $6 million.</p><h2 id=audrey-mirabella-botti><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Audrey Mirabella Botti</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-1-million>Net Worth: $1 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/audrey-roloff-and-husband-1-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Audrey will not be appearing in Season 25 of Little People, Big World</strong></li></ul><p>Audrey is a well-known American blogger and television personality who rose to fame through her publications.
