That is if you choose to watch.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MEAWW</a> caught up with Dennie Augustine, said to be the 'Godmutha' of the crew, and also "the life of the party", for her insights into the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2736203f-3443-40b9-8971-8a0fbf4177fa.jpg><p>After watching the pilot episode, there's a fair idea on who these young individuals are and among the lot, Dennie seems to be one of the few who made it out of the borough to pursue her education. MTV described the show to be a coming-of-age series when the Staten Islanders "battle each other, and the odds, to step out from the shadows and change the reputation of the Island. These friends will either choose wisely, or fall prey to the mistakes of past generations."</p><p>Dennie is definitely the one who seems to have forged her own path already, and her crew members display a lot of respect. However, as narrated on the trailer of 'Made In Staten Island', it's hard to leave the streets.</p><p>So when Dennie moves back to Staten Island from New Jersey, after finishing her college, she is in a fix about what to do next. She tells her mother that she is considering being a stripper.</p><p>Her mother flips and looses her cool and asks Dennie where all these ideas are coming from?</p><p>MEAWW asked the same question, and Dennie laughed.</p><p>"I meant it as a joke," says Dennie. "I don't have the body for it and I don't have the moves for it," she says.</p><p>Even though the show is a "mob show" coming from the star of 'Mob Wives', Karen Gravano, daughter of Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, the show isn't solely about crimes and criminals. Dennie is a perfect example of that.</p><p>After spending four years out of Staten Island, the borough native had an incredible experience meeting "a bunch of different people from everywhere," in her college life and learning more about different cultures."I would 100 percent encourage people to step away from the Island for a little bit because there's a whole big world out there, and even though education was a big part of my time there, it was the incredible people I got to meet that's been my takeaway," says Dennie.</p><p>Now that she has moved back to the borough, Dennie shares that the transition has been a difficult one. "It's been a little weird," says Dennie, adding "I was living in my own house at school for about four years with my best friends with no adult supervision at all. So coming back home has been a little difficult because that was basically me realizing that I have to become an adult at some point."</p><p>"I handled it really well and now I'm a big girl, doing the big girl," she affirms.</p><p>However, Dennie does not plan on living in Staten Island for long, since in the next five years she sees herself working in Manhattan. "I don't know what I'll be doing, but I know whatever I'll be doing, it will be big," says Dennie, who is assured in the pilot episode by her mother that she is a very capable woman.&nbsp;</p><p>Known as the 'Godmutha' of the group, Dennie is seen taking the role of a mediator for the crew, fixing all their problems, be it relationship issues or legal troubles. She is the one everyone runs to. "I'm a very positive fun-loving human being and I always want to put smiles on everybody's faces. I do not accept negative vibe. But I don't know where the nickname Godmutha came from," says Dennie, adding that she is, in fact, a godmother in real life and has "three different kids".&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe because I like to watch over my people and make sure that they're on the right track, even though my track might be a little bumpy," she reflects.</p><p>Appearing head-strong and cool, Dennie appears like a best friend on the show where you would expect serious fights. Even though Dennie had a beef with Kayla a long time ago, they soon became friends and feature in the series as best of friends.</p><p>Dennie will be seen helping, guiding and nurturing the crew members on the series. "Everybody knows that Staten Island is a really small place. So all my crew members have met each other at all different stages of growing up," she tells of her friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with Dennie, there other six Staten Island teens are Christian 'CP' Patterson, Paulie Fusco, Karina Seabrook, Kayla 'KG' Gonzalez, Taylor Toolee and Joe Toole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGZsm61zWaqrZmkmrtutdKlmKecXZmyr7rInmSarZeqwLW1zZ5koKeUosK1tMBmmqudp2K6tcKMp5ywZZqav7Sx2A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
