This discretion, while commendable, has sparked speculation and conjecture about her relationships and sexuality. While the rumors continue to circulate, Hawke's insistence on delineating her private life is refreshing in a world where public figures' personal lives are often overexposed, yet it leaves the door open for numerous assumptions.</p><h2 id=maya-hawke-39-s-roles-have-fans-wonder-if-she-39-s-gay-in-real-life><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Maya Hawke's Roles Have Fans Wonder If She's Gay In Real Life?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Maya-Hawke-in-Do-Revenge-via-Slash-Film.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Indeed, Maya Hawke's choice of roles, especially those with undefined or LGBTQ+ sexual orientations, has led to conjecture about her real-life sexuality. According to Tuko, her portrayal of Jo March in the BBC adaptation of Little Women, a character with an ambiguous sexuality in the original novel, added fuel to the rumors.</p><p>Similarly, her depiction of Robin in Stranger Things, a character openly attracted to women, prompted further queries. Beyond these roles, Hawke's character Eleanor in Do Revenge, who is in a same-sex relationship, further deepens the intrigue.</p><h2 id=has-maya-hawke-commented-on-her-sexuality><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Has Maya Hawke Commented On Her Sexuality?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230626_134446_0000.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to We Got This Covered, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya Hawke's sexuality has been a topic of conversation</a> due to her representation of diverse characters on-screen and her decision to remain relatively silent about her personal life.
