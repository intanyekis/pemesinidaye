He is aware that the goal of law enforcement is not personal gain but rather the protection of the weak and the interests of the public. Even his readiness to take criticism and grow as a result of it shows modesty.</p><p>Officer Wood embodies every quality a great leader should have. He motivates those around him more via his actions than words, and as a result, they respect and believe in him.</p><p>His unwavering commitment to duty, unwavering honesty, and unwavering compassion have inspired many in the law enforcement community.</p><p><strong>How did the accident happen?</strong></p><p>The crash happened on Wednesday about 5:40 p.m., according to Corporal David Jones of the South Carolina Highway Patrol. A 2022 Freightliner tractor-trailer was headed east on SC-34, also known as Dixie Drive, while a 2015 Ford Taurus from the Newberry Police Department was traveling south on SC-395, also known as Nance Street.</p><p>These two roads’ intersection ended up being the scene of the unfortunate occurrence. The Newberry Police vehicle’s driver sustained serious injuries as a result of the collision, and he was immediately taken to a local hospital.</p><p>Tragically, the cop passed away from his wounds soon after. According to Jones, the tractor-trailer’s driver also sustained injuries and was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p><p>The City of Newberry revealed in a separate statement that the officer killed in the accident was responding to a plea for help when it occurred.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7zKKaoZmVoXqutcqeZLCnn5l6pK3RZpicm5mZsq%2FAjKecsJqVp7%2B6edKcZKmnnJ6wpnnDnqeaqqSisq%2FAjKWgnq2kmruiutNmpKKbmJayrXnMoqKeZaekvKV5w6KcrGWZo3q1vsCgoJxlk5a%2Fbq%2FRmqqhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
