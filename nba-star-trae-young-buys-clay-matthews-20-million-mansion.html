He played college basketball for the Oklahoma Sooners. In 2017, he tied the then-record in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I single-game assists with 22, Trae Young is currently playing on a contract worth north of $240 million, so it’s no surprise he can afford some very nice things. Records show the Texas native, 24, who mainly splits his time between Atlanta and Oklahoma, has paid exactly $20 million for the sprawling Calabasas home of retired NFL linebacker Clay Matthews. The all-custom estate sits within the Estates at the Oaks, a double-gated community where other residents include Britney Spears, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>The 10 Biggest Philanthropic Ventures Of Sandra Bullock</b></a></span></p><p>While that’s the second-biggest sum ever paid for a Calabasas home, behind only the $30 million a tech entrepreneur forked over on the same street last year, it’s also a 50% discount off Matthews’ original asking price. The former L.A. Rams star picked up the then-vacant property in 2013 for about $2.6 million and spent untold millions custom-building his California dream home, much of which was designed by his wife Casey. The couple are reportedly relocating from their palatial Calabasas home to Nashville, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><p>Vaguely French Provincial in architectural style, albeit with a serious contemporary twist, the hulking manor spans some 14,000 square feet and comes complete with seven bedrooms suites and 11 bathrooms. In addition to a large front motorcourt and separate gated second motorcourt, there’s also a partially subterranean garage with room for up to nine cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Inside, highlights include numerous bespoke finishes — intricate millwork and moldings, wide-plank walnut flooring, antique wood beams reclaimed from ancient barns, and unusually high ceilings throughout add to the feeling of grandeur. There’s also a wine cellar with storage space for thousands of bottles, a movie theater that can accommodate 15 guests, and perhaps the property’s most impressive feature — a wood-paneled library with an 800-gallon aquarium, professionally designed for Matthews on a 2018 episode of “Tanked.”</p><p>The upstairs master suite features a sitting area and a sumptuous bathroom slathered in Borghini marble, per the listing. Out back, the 1.63-acre lot boasts views of the Santa Monica Mountains, a saltwater swimming pool and a sports court, plus the manicured gardens and lawns one would expect to find at a $20 million Los Angeles estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his giant new Calabasas digs, Young continues to maintain homes in Atlanta’s Brookhaven neighborhood and Oklahoma, where he’s got an 8,000 square foot mansion in the city of Norman.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmanmpFiwLWt0Warq5mVYsawwc2gZJutqah6pLjAsmSmmaSptabD0mZpaWWdnrmttc6nZKaZnqi2sLqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
