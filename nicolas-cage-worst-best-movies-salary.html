He first appeared in films such as Raising Arizona and Vampire's Kiss, where he received mostly critical acclaim. However, 1995's Leaving Las Vegas was one of Cage's breakout moments. The actor was supposed to be paid $100,000 for the movie, but according to The Hollywood Reporter, he was never given any money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Delilah Lounge In Las Vegas Is A Magnet For Stars Like Kylie Jenner And Justin Bieber</a></span></p><p>Over the years, Nicolas had grown a reputation for being an extremely over-the-top actor. This was the first movie where that was truly the case, but in this instance, it really enhanced the film. Nicolas's character endured a slow mental breakdown due to his time living in Sin City, and the acting was so good that Nicolas won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It's a shame that the award is the only thing he got for the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-nicolas-cage-make-from-the-rock><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Much Did Nicolas Cage Make From The Rock?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sean-connery.jpg><p>By the time 1996 rolled around, Nic Cage was starting to become a household name. On the heels of his Oscar-winning performance, he starred alongside Sean Connery in an enormous blockbuster movie called The Rock. Nicolas plays a scientist while Sean plays a retired SAS soldier, who many theorize might just be an older version of James Bond. According to FanBolt, both actors made roughly $500,000 from The Rock.</p><p><a href=#>Sean Connery was actually supposed to play Gandalf</a> in the iconic Lord of the Rings trilogy right after this but turned it down. Maybe after all the crazy action in The Rock, he wanted something more peaceful and laidback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-nicolas-cage-make-from-face-off><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Did Nicolas Cage Make From Face/Off?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nic-Cage-Screaming-in-Face_Off.jpg><p>John Travolta has a lot of films he may regret starring in, <a href=#>such as Battlefield: Earth</a>. However, there's little doubt that he's upset about featuring in Face/Off, as the movie was both a box office and critical hit. The movie made $250 million at the box office and has been well remembered two decades later. According to Cattle Call Auditions, Nic Cage made $6 million from Face/Off.</p><p>Some fans have noticed how the upcoming Fast X movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is very reminiscent of Face/Off</a>. Only time will tell how similar the two movies are.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-nicolas-cage-make-from-snake-eyes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Did Nicolas Cage Make From Snake Eyes?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nicolas-cage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This movie has been slightly forgotten over time, but it was one of Cage's better works. 1998's Snake Eyes was about a detective investigating both a political mystery and an Atlantic City boxing mystery. The movie featured a lesser-known Luis Guzman, who is a superstar now due to his time on Netflix's Wednesday. It was pretty good and featured some of Cage's funniest moments.</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Nic made an astounding $16 million from Snake Eyes. The total budget was just north of $70 million, and unfortunately, it only made $103 million at the worldwide box office.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-nicolas-cage-make-from-gone-in-60-seconds><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Did Nicolas Cage Make From Gone In 60 Seconds?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nicolas-cage-and-angelina-jolie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gone In 60 Seconds continued Cage's streak of big Hollywood blockbusters. This may have been his biggest, but also one that wasn't received too well. The cast was absolutely star-studded, with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall having important parts alongside Nicolas. It ended up making over $200 million at the box office, so it wasn't a total failure. However, one would think with those names, it could have been a little better.</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Nicolas made around $20 million for Gone In 60 Seconds. If that's how much he made, then Angelina should have commanded a similar amount as well. As huge as Cage was at the time, she was even more of a household name.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-nicolas-cage-make-from-national-treasure><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Did Nicolas Cage Make From National Treasure?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/National-Treasure-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the 00s, Nicolas's status as an A-list star started to decline. He was still one of the biggest names in Hollywood, but after a few critical bombs, his presence wasn't as assuring for movie studios. His only big movies during this time were the Ghost Rider and National Treasure films.</p><p>The National Treasure movies were interesting action mysteries similar to the Indiana Jones films. The movies were focused more on the history side of things, although there was still some action. According to FanBuzz, Nicolas made $20 million for both National Treasure films he starred in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will There Ever Actually Be A 'National Treasure 3'?</a></span></p><p>National Treasure: Edge of History is the spiritual successor to the National Treasure movies.

The film starred Nic Cage, alongside other big-name actors like Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds. It might just be a simple kids' movie, but it wasn't bad by any means. The sequel was also pretty big, although it wasn't released until 2020.</p><p>Per Cattle Call Auditions, Nicolas made $1 million for the first Croods movie.

For a while, he was in massive debt. He told GQ that he started accepting whatever movies would pay him the most money, regardless of their quality. While he normally assures interviewers that he has never phoned anything in, his reputation has been slightly soured because of his VOD films.</p><p>One of Cage's better VOD movies has been 2021's Pig. Many believe it to be Cage's best film in a long time, and it even won some awards.
