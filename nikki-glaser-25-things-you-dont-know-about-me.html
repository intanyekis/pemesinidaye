The part that I love so much about it is that I was able, as the host, to bring a comedic voice to the show,” Glaser <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in July 2021</a> of the HBO Max dating series, which began airing its second season earlier this month. “The women will get to date 24 men — 12 nice guys hoping to find The One and 12 self-proclaimed FBoys hoping to win some money.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “We watch these shows and we laugh amongst each other, and we laugh with the people we’re watching them with. We make fun of it, but the shows rarely make fun of themselves or acknowledge the fact that what’s happening is hilarious. I was able to do that as the host of the show and the people I made the show with were down to, kind of, change the format.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to learn more about the comedian:</p><p><span class=s1>1.
