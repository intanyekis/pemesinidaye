Diddy and Cassie were together in a now-closed Los Angeles hotel in 2016, and Diddy can be seen grabbing her by the neck before throwing her to the ground and kicking her twice. He also attempted to drag her back to their room and later can be seen throwing objects at her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The mogul shared an <a href=#>apology video </a>days later. “My behavior in that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I’m disgusted,” he said. “I was disgusted&nbsp;then&nbsp;when I did it, I’m disgusted now.&nbsp;I went and I sought out professional help&nbsp;and&nbsp;I had to go into therapy. We’re going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace.&nbsp;I’m so sorry, but I’m committed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a better man&nbsp;each and every&nbsp;day.&nbsp;I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">People weren’t receptive to the apology, especially when he denied all of the allegations against him in a <a href=#>statement</a> back in December 2023. Social media users were also frustrated that he did not specifically address Cassie nor apologize to her. <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ</a> later revealed that the terms of their November 2023 settlement included an <a href=#>NDA</a> that does not allow them to say each other’s names in public. His lawyers even reviewed the apology video to ensure he upheld the terms of the settlement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#>Lil Scrappy</a> wasn’t a fan of what Diddy did to Cassie or his apology, and said he was willing to fight him if they saw each other in person. “If that ni**a Diddy walked past me right now, I’d take the fade with him,” the Atlanta rapper said. “Just ’cause… I don’t care about no apology and all that… The way he did shawty, that was foul. That was some real bi**h sh*t. And you could tell he was doing that sh*t for a long time, ’cause she was frantic.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This is the latest in an <a href=#>eventful 2024</a> for the “I Need A Girl” artist which included another sexual assault lawsuit from <a href=#>producer Lil Rod </a>and <a href=#>Homeland Security </a>raiding his Los Angeles and Miami homes as part of a sex trafficking investigation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6PGpHnMmrCoql2av6qvjJqbmqWjYrCwutKim56qmaO0bsDApKCnn12ZtqWw2GainrFdqbxur8itsGZpYmiBeYSPam5uZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
