He's so good, in fact, that he's already joined the conversation for greatest quarterback of all time despite being in the league for less than a decade. In this time, he's won three Super Bowls, as well as multiple regular season and postseason MVPs.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Mahomes has been well-paid for his success. His contract with the Kansas City Chiefs ranks as one of the most lucrative in the entire sport, but what fans may not realize is that <a href=#>Mahomes' net worth has skyrocketed</a> after securing his third Super Bowl ring. How? Well, the answer is pretty simple, actually: winners get paid more.</p><h2 id=patrick-mahomes-was-given-a-990k-pay-raise-after-winning-his-third-super-bowl>Patrick Mahomes Was Given A $990K Pay Raise After Winning His Third Super Bowl</h2><p>Patrick Mahomes is officially spearheading a dynasty. He's <a href=#>led the Kansas City Chiefs to three Super Bowl titles</a> in the span of five years, and as such, the team's front office has made sure that he is properly rewarded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/patrick-mahomes-super-bowl.jpg><p>The Mirror reported that <strong>Mahomes is slated to receive a gigantic pay raise of $998,000</strong> for the upcoming NFL season, which will be added to his normal salary.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Mahomes' 2023-24 salary (According To The Mirror)</p></td><td><p>$6.8 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mahomes' 2024-25 salary (According To The Mirror)</p></td><td><p>$7.79 Million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The justification for the gigantic pay raise, according to CBS News reporter Joel Corry, is that Mahomes surpassed the 50% mark for playtime during the regular season and postseason, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which automatically earns him a base salary increase</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mahomes is benefiting greatly from the stipulations of his recent contract negotiation. He signed an extension deal with the Kansas City Chiefs in September 2023, which guaranteed him a total of $210 million over the next four years. The salary increase means that Mahomes will actually earn an extra $4-5 million in the same time span.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:26</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/patrick-mahomes-wife-brittany-has-been-brutally-criticized-for-some-truly-odd-reasons-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Patrick Mahomes’ Wife Brittany Has Been Brutally Criticized For Some Truly Odd Reasons">Patrick Mahomes’ Wife Brittany Has Been Brutally Criticized For Some Truly Odd Reasons</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Why do Patrick Mahomes' fans have such a big problem with his wife Brittany?</p><p>When asked about the contract negotiation, and the salary increase, Mahomes told Forbes that it made focusing on the game easier:</p><p>"You get that security.

It's normal for Super Bowl champs to receive bonuses, but $1.25 million is far and away the most of any player on the Chiefs, and its due to specific agreements that Mahomes has in his contract.</p><p>It gets even more impressive when one considers that Mahomes received his $1.25 million bonus on top of the bonuses he received for winning each of the playoff games that preceded the Super Bowl. <strong>He made an extra $388,000 for those victories</strong>, which break down like this:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>NFL Payoff Game</p></td><td><p>Mahomes' Bonuses (According To CBS)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Wild Card round</p></td><td><p>$50,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Divisional round</p></td><td><p>$50,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AFC Championship</p></td><td><p>$73,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Super Bowl</p></td><td><p>$164,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Yes, in addition to the $1.25 million Super Bowl bonus, Mahomes was given the $164,000 bonus that's given to each of the main position players on the Chiefs.</p><p>Mahomes is committed to winning, but he made it clear during an interview with AP News that he also felt it was important to be paid for his stellar performance on the field:</p><p>"I want to make a lot of money but I also want to win.

It's a bit of a confusing technicality, but <a href=#>Burrow takes home more per season</a> than Mahomes despite the latter having an overall more lucrative contract. Here's how it shakes out:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Name</p></td><td><p>Annual Salary</p></td><td><p>Overall Contract (According To CBS)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Joe Burrow</p></td><td><p>$55 Million</p></td><td><p>$275 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Patrick Mahomes</p></td><td><p>$52.65 Million</p></td><td><p>$450 Million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mahomes' net worth also exceeds Joe Burrow's, which currently sits at $50 million. There's little more for the stalwart quarterback to achieve from a monetary standpoint, which may be why he was so keen on shifting the focus to other topics during a recent press conference.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked about the specifics of his earnings, Mahomes asserted that he is more than happy with the money that he's been paid by the Kansas City Chiefs, and that his main focus past Super Bowl LVIII is simply to win more titles.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/was-jackson-mahomes-ever-embarrassed-by-controversial-brother-jackson-s-behaviour-on-tiktok_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Was Patrick Mahomes Ever Embarrassed By Controversial Brother Jackson's Behaviour On TikTok?">Was Patrick Mahomes Ever Embarrassed By Controversial Brother Jackson's Behaviour On TikTok?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jackson Mahomes has been on the frontlines for questionable behavior, and his NFL quarterback brother may be too embarrassed to speak up.</p><p>When asked about the desire to surpass Burrow as the highest-paid quarterback, Mahomes insisted that it's "not about" titles of status, but Super Bowl titles:</p><p>"I've made enough money where I'll be set for the rest of my life.
