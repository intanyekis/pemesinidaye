(Harry reportedly found out about <a href=#>Kate’s cancer diagnosis</a> along with the rest of the world.) “There hasn’t been more contact between William and Harry,” says a source. “Harry and Meghan reached out to him, but it hasn’t opened up the lines of conversation. They still do not communicate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-2418-Us-Weekly-Cover-No-Chip.jpg><h3>A Vulnerable Charles</h3><p>On February 5, Buckingham Palace revealed Charles had been diagnosed <a href=#>with an unspecified cancer</a> after he underwent treatment for an enlarged prostate a few weeks earlier. In March, royal author <strong>Christopher Andersen</strong> told Us he believes Charles’ prognosis is “more serious than we are being led to believe,” adding, “William has the double whammy of having to see his father deal with this and his wife.”</p><h3>Kate’s Health Crisis</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Kate-Middleton-Cancer-Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-2418-Us-Weekly.jpg><p>The princess’ absence has been keenly felt as she’s remained largely out of the public eye since being diagnosed with cancer following a planned abdominal surgery in mid-January. “The nation is gunning for Kate to get better,” says royal expert <strong>Tessa Dunlop</strong>. “The monarchy needs her.” Fellow royals expert<strong> Gareth Russell</strong> says she may attend the annual Trooping the Colour in June but notes “that could change at a moment’s notice.”</p><h3>Dad Duties</h3><p>While Kate undergoes treatment, William has his <a href=#>hands full at home</a> with George, Louis and Charlotte. He’s said to be taking them to and from school, and during their recent spring break, the hands-on dad spent time painting with them and doing archery. “They all [also] love to play cards,” says a source. “That’s something that Kate can be involved with as well and that they’ve always loved to do as a family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>His In-Laws’ Debt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Carol-Middleton-and-Michael-Francis-Middleton-Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-2418-Us-Weekly.jpg><p>According to reports, Kate’s parents, <strong>Carole</strong> and <strong>Michael Middleton</strong>, are in debt for more than $300,000 after selling their children’s party supplies company, <a href=#>Party Pieces, in 2023</a> after 36 years in business. “It’s been devastating for the family, but Carole will be most concerned about Kate’s well-being right now,” says royal commentator <strong>Afua Hagan</strong>. “She will be pulling out all the stops to shield Kate from this.”</p><h3>Face of the Monarchy</h3><p>Despite some help from <strong>Queen Camilla</strong> and his aunt and uncle, <strong>Princess Sophie</strong> and <strong>Prince Edward</strong>, William is currently the most public-facing royal by a mile, attending a series of meetings and events, including the BAFTAs, solo. “The whole fate of the monarchy rests on his shoulders,” says Andersen. “I’m sure it’s a crushing weight, and it’s happening much earlier than he thought it would.”</p><h3>Edward and Sophie Step Up</h3><p>The Firm is making some changes on the front line. On April 8, Prince Edward (King Charles’ youngest brother) and his wife, Duchess Sophie, took center stage during a historic military event at Buckingham Palace. Charles asked the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh to host dignitaries, including <strong>Her Excellency Hélène Duchêne</strong>, the French ambassador to the U.K., at the high-profile affair. It’s a clear sign there’s been a change of guard for the royal family. Royal historian Russell, author of The Palace: From the Tudors to the Windsors, 500 Years of British History at Hampton Court, says it’s likely Edward, 60, Sophie, 59, and their daughter, <strong>Lady Louise Windsor</strong>, 20, “will be moved into <a href=#>senior working royal status</a> because otherwise [things are] unsustainable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ51qKjpaGRosBuu82gpqKml2K%2FsMXApWSfmZ2eubp51qipq6GVqHqpscClq6Flk6e2tLXSZpinnF2ivLOxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
