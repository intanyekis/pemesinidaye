He has recalled that he was playing baseball and he was good at it but his team lacked the drive he had and that made him dislike the group concept of sports. Ryan started to crave a sport where it would be a one-on-one game and he had asked his uncle if he could find a sport that would be all on him. His uncle then had shown him a video of a sport named boxing that made him want to try it and so he had taken him to his garage and put on a pair of gloves on him. Ryan has gone on to add that the moment when he had done the first jab, he had completely fallen in love with just the sound of the mitt.</li><li>Ryan’s parents had always been actively involved in his amateur career having continued to have helped him with his professional career.</li><li>He has stated that boxing is dangerous and anything can happen, and that has been the reason he has tried to represent himself as if nobody can beat him, as he has known that he truly needs to believe it and have supreme confidence.</li><li>Ryan has frequently incorporated his Mexican heritage into his persona having carried both the U.S and Mexican flags into the ring and worn red, white, and blue colors. He has affirmed that he has carried the U.S. as well as Mexico in his heart and represented them both in the ring as he has considered it the most important to know where he came from, in order to know and understand where he is going.</li><li>In January 2022, Ryan was openly challenged on Twitter by <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Bryce Hall</a> for a boxing match. To which, Ryan made it clear that if he didn’t manage to knockout Bryce in 20 seconds, then, Bryce would win.</li><p>Featured Image by Ryan Garcia / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jquwmqZdnK6zr8iaZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
