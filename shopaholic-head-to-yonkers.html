A new REI outdoor clothing and equipment store and a multiplex movie theater became the first retailers to debut at the center just last week.
Ridge Hill is a 1.2 million square foot regional, mixed-use center under construction on a sprawling hilly area between the Sprain Brook Parkway and the New York State Thruway, just about opposite Stew Leonard’s and the Home Depot."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A 10,000 square-foot cutting-edge designer department store called Republic of Couture is also making its latest area debut.</p><p>These join the 25,300 square foot REI, an upcoming 50,000 square-foot Whole Foods, an upcoming 50,000 square-foot Dick’s Sporting Goods and others that are already signed and in construction.</p><p>The 70,000 square-foot National Cinema that opened last week has 12 theatres including an IMAX.</p><p>An 80,000 square-foot Lord & Taylor will be the department store’s first new ground-up store in over a decade. Its wavy glass façade has been designed by the Italian designer Giorgio Borruso Design, based in Marina del Rey, Calif.</p><p>“It is a bold statement and a real asset for our property,” said Silberfein, executive vice president, director of retail development and finance for FCRC.</p><p>A 23,000 square-foot L.L. Bean will also become the first in the local region.</p><p>There are also 12 to 15 restaurants coming that Silberfein said will include Brio, Texas De Brazil, Yard House and the Cheesecake Factory.</p><p>Peter Ripka, principal of Ripco Real Estate and the leasing consultant for FCRC, called Ridge Hill a “great” site.</p><p>“To me, that’s where it starts. In the city, it’s how great is the corner but in the suburbs it has to be a great site,” Ripka explained. “This has great demographics locally, and with two highways, there is access regionally. It’s kind of a happy place, and feels good when you are there,” Ripka added.</p><p>Silberfein said Westchester is the third wealthiest county in the US but under-retailed by 5 million square-feet because the entitlement process is so difficult.</p><p>“A number of the top retailers in the country are choosing the vision we created, and understand the demographics of the area and the accessibility,” Silberfein said. Over 52 million cars per year pass by the site on the two adjacent highways.</p><p>While Whole Foods and Dick’s are scheduled to open in September, a grand opening celebration for the center is scheduled for Oct. 20.</p><p>In June, however, Ridge Hill will have a special event for the opening of its majestic fountain centerpiece designed by WET, which is known worldwide for its visionary fountains in places like the Lincoln Center, the Bellagio in Las Vegas and Dubai.</p><p>“The WET design is really incredible,” said Silberfein. “There will be choreographed sheets of water and fire and shows throughout the night. This has never been done before anywhere in the world.”</p><p>We can’t wait.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnJ7j25ma2xfqLWwvMChpqWhk2K1pq3DZquoZamku6yx0axm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
