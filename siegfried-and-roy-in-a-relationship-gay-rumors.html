Growing up in post-war Germany, the magicians independently desired to one day work in the circus. Siegfried was obsessed with magic, while Roy had an intense interest and obsession with animals.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adele And Every Other Celebrity Who Had Major Las Vegas Residency Problem</a></span></p><p>Siegfried and Roy met as waiters on the passenger ship TS Bremen.

One is an essay written in 2008 by Jeffrey L. Bohn titled "Escape To Queer Mountain". The article proclaimed that the two magicians had a secret relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other was Siegfried and Roy's unflinching support of the LGBTQ+ community throughout their careers. They held performances in honor of the LGBTQ+ community and spoke out during a time when it wasn't popular to do so. On top of that, they dressed similarly to other LGBTQ+ stars from the same time period.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not they dated, they were very connected to each other. They had an intense love, even if there was no physical romance at any point in time.</p><h2 id=siegfried-and-roy-lived-together-in-the-little-bavaria><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Siegfried And Roy Lived Together In The Little Bavaria</span></h2><p>Siegfried and Roy lived in Las Vegas way before the <a href=#>current wave of celebrities</a> swarmed the desert city.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While in Europe, Siegfried and Roy traveled a lot and never really had a home. But when they settled down in Las Vegas, they went on to own and live in one of the most famous mansions in the entire world.</p><p>The mansion, called Little Bavaria, was located on a patch of land over 100 acres wide. The grassy and palm tree-laden estate stands out among the desert backdrop. The compound even features a gigantic pool and cove at the center of the estate, in a state that struggles to maintain its water supply.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Nicolas Cage Left His $25 Million Home In Newport Beach, California For Las Vegas</a></span></p><p>The reason it even exists is that it was built right before a special era of Las Vegas building restrictions existed. Siegfried and Roy have said multiple times that Little Bavaria couldn't even be built under today's Las Vegas codes.</p><p>Both Siegfried and Roy called this place their home for multiple decades, until their unfortunate deaths.

The cat proceeded to swing at Roy while numerous assistants and security tried getting the tiger off of him. Roy struggled to recover for the rest of his life and needed medical care until his passing in 2020. Siegfried took primary care of him, suggesting heavily that they had an intimate relationship.</p><p>There are many rumors and stories about the drama that occurred that night. There are conspiracy theories that <a href=#>someone was behind the attack</a>. Many critics have put the blame on Roy for mishandling Mantacore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's also a belief that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simpsons predicted it</a>.</p><h2 id=when-did-siegfried-and-roy-pass-away><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>When Did Siegfried And Roy Pass Away?</span></h2><p>Roy Horn passed away due to COVID-19 in 2020.
