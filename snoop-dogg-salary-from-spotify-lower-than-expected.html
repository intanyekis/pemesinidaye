Believe it or not, he first rose to fame back in 1992 when he made a guest appearance on Dr. Dre’s debut solo single, ‘Deep Cover,’ and first album, The Chronic. A year later, Snoop released his debut album, Doggystyle, which made it to number one on the Billboard 200! It’s no wonder why Snoop is considered one of the biggest icons of gangsta rap.</p><p>Since his debut album came out in 1993, Snoop has released 19 other studio albums and seven collaboration albums. Throughout his career, this rapper has sold over 35 million albums across the world.</p><p>He’s also very popular on streaming services, with billions of streams on Spotify alone. However, in a recent interview, Snoop Dogg revealed how much he actually makes from Spotify streams. It’s way lower than one would think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snoop-Dogg-Looking-Upset.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Snoop Dogg Fans Have No Idea His Career Almost Came To An End Decades Ago</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Snoop was almost found guilty of something that would have ended his career in a heartbeat.</span><h2 id=snoop-dogg-39-s-over-1-billion-streams-on-spotify-amounted-to-45-000>Snoop Dogg's Over 1 Billion Streams On Spotify Amounted To $45,000</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/snoop-dogg.jpg><p>As of today, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snoop Dogg has more than 14 billion streams on Spotify</a> in total. One would assume that so many streams would amount to large sums of money for the rapper. However, this is far from the truth. In an appearance on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">podcast Business Untitled</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snoop revealed how much he makes from streams on Spotify</a> and, it’s not a lot.</p><p>The rapper admitted that both the music and the film industry lack transparency.

But this is not the case.</p><p>"I said, 'Break that down, how much money is that?'” Snoop then revealed the actual sum he got from Spotify: "That s**t wasn't even $45,000."</p><p>This explains why no artists, big or small, rely on Spotify or other streaming services to make a living.

His highest-streamed song is a collaboration with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bruno Mars</a>. The song ‘Young, Wild & Free’ has a total of 1.3 billion streams, with half a million daily streams. Snoop’s second most-streamed song is ‘Still D.R.E.’, which also has over 1.3 billion total streams. Some other of the rapper’s most popular songs on Spotify are ‘The Next Episode,’ ‘California Gurls,’ and ‘Drop It Like It’s Hot.’</p><p>Given that his songs are streamed by thousands, if not millions of people every day, it’s surprising that Snoop only made $45,000 from Spotify streams last year. But this is not new. Over the years, many small <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">artists have called out Spotify for not paying them their fair share</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>No One Knew This Rumor About Snoop Dogg Was True (Until Cameron Diaz Confirmed It)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Cameron Diaz let the cat out of the bag about Snoop Dogg during an interview. But, really, it was something fans already suspected about the rapper.</span><p>Most streaming services, including Spotify, don’t have a flat rate per stream. Instead, they use a pro-rata payment model to pay artists. In Spotify’s case, they collect all advertising and subscription revenue over a month, then share 70% (with the other 30% going directly to Spotify) with artists based on the number of streams they accrued during that month. According to Business Insider, this means that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spotify pays artists around $0.003 and $0.005 per stream.</a></p><p>Of course, the most popular artists are able to make millions from this system. For instance, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift is said to have made $84K per week with only one song</a>. By being the most streamed artist of 2023, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Swift made over $100 million from Spotify streams</a> last year.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg-still-has-an-impressive-net-worth-of-160-million>Snoop Dogg Still Has An Impressive Net Worth Of $160 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite not making a lot of money from Spotify, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Snoop Dogg has an impressive $160 million net worth</a>. Most of his fortune comes from his record sales and concerts, including his <a href=# rel=nofollow>performance at the Super Bowl</a>. However, Snoop has also made a good sum of money by appearing in popular movies and TV shows, as well as by hosting a cooking show alongside Martha Stewart.</p><p>Over the years, Snoop has also invested in real estate. In 2007, the rapper sold an eight-bedroom home in Claremont, California for $1.83 million, even though the house was worth $660,000 back when he bought it in 1994. In addition to this, Snoop owns a home in Diamond Bar, California, which he purchased in 199, and is said to have <a href=# rel=nofollow>bought a house on the same street as his mansion</a>, a complex he calls Tha Chuuuch.</p><p>It’s clear that Snoop Dogg won’t be running out of money any time soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqp6efpXqlu8agZKyZnJa%2FunnFq6amZaOlvLW1xbJkpaenmr9uwMeapWadqKWypMDEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
