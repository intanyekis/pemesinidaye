This incident went viral through various videos, and some internet users even pointed out similarities to an episode of “The Boondocks” called “Granddad’s Fight,” which seemed to predict the event back in 2005.</p><p>According to The New York Post, the brawl at the Riverfront Park started when a security guard asked some boaters to move their pontoon boat from a space designated for the Harriott ship. Despite the request, the boaters refused and a heated confrontation unfolded between them and the security guard. Initially, one man attacked the guard, and soon after, others joined in on the assault. Nearby witnesses called for help, and bystanders rushed to the guard’s defense. Amid the chaos, someone even used a folding chair as a weapon, and a woman accidentally fell into the water during the scuffle.</p><p>Eventually, the situation was brought under control, and video footage of the brawl spread across the internet. Many viewers drew parallels between the brawl and an episode from “The Boondocks,” specifically episode 4, where a character tosses a folding chair in response to a group of angry individuals, triggering a full-blown brawl. This clip from the show went viral in the wake of the Riverfront Park incident, with some referring to it as the “black folks version of The Simpsons.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Boondocks really black folks version of the Simpsons.

The altercation unfolded around 7 pm on a Saturday evening. It all began when a black security guard asked a white man to relocate his boat in order to make room for the Harriott II Riverfront boat. Numerous individuals became involved in the altercation, leading to multiple arrests by the Montgomery police. Although specific identities of those arrested remain undisclosed, USA Today reported that the police had issued four warrants in connection with the case, and additional details are pending.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kwamxjJumqKaUpLCsv4ycn5qhomLBqb7OsGSsm5Wjsm7AwKScrGWZo8Gmvs2eq2aaqWLAtbvRpmSapZmZeq67za2eqKWVp8ZuvsivnKueoqS7tXnBq5iwpF2rtqWxzmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
