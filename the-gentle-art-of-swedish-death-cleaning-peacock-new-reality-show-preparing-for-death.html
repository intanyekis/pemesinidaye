Television networks have released hundreds of shows to quench our thirst for comforting reality TV content. Although the shows are based on varying concepts, they are almost always an unadulterated celebration of youth and physical fitness. Rarely does reality television venture into the dark, uncomfortable, and morbid aspects of life, such as aging, disability, and dying.Peacock’s newest reality show departs from this paradigm by focusing on end-of-life planning. If aired, the show will demonstrate that reality TV can create an avenue for viewers to confront and navigate complex situations and overwhelming emotions. It could also illustrate that end-of-life planning does not have to be as disempowering as it is often portrayed in popular culture. Here’s everything we know about the new, seemingly morbid reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nbc-rsquo-s-peacock-has-ordered-a-new-reality-show-about-death><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>NBC’s Peacock Has Ordered A New Reality Show About Death</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC’s streaming platform Peacock recently greenlit</a> a new unscripted reality show dubbed The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning.
