He says that there are not much films in Bollywood based on young boys and girls. He has also worked with kids before. The debutante director has done TV show “School Days” on Doordarshan.</p><p>After this movie, he will be taking the projects related to&nbsp;detective story and a psychological thriller. When asked about what according to him is the difference between doing the TV show and a film, he mentioned that the public pays a lot to watch the film; so actors need to engage the audience in a two-and-half-hour movie. Whereas in a TV show, the actors can improve their performance in the next episode.</p><p>The movie trailer is shown right below.</p><p>The movie is based on the lives of Indian youth, depicting India where growing up has speeded up many times from days gone by. In the time of increasing modern technologies, the youth at the innocent age of 16 is losing it innocence.</p><p>Coming up to the promotion, every film now does its promotions. The actors would appear on various famous daily soaps, cricket matches, reality shows, etc. to promote their film as much as possible. But, this one is different. Yes, they are promoting their film in a different manner. The team has hired teenage girls to promote the film by showing the trailers of the film to the public in the shopping malls, multiplexes, cinema halls. The girls would present their tabs to the people and would request them to see at least one trailer of the film.</p><p>The movie poster features the Brazilian model, Izabelle.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2Bgq5mkYriwtMuiZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmoaqWr6a4y55kpZ2ZqbJutdJmmKdlkZjBs7HSrGStp59k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
