In the winter, we prefer to wear thicker wool coats, parkas and faux-fur jackets — and once the spring season starts to break through, we shift to lighter options. With that in mind, there are a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">slew of styles</a> that we can make work any time of the year!</p><p>In a dream world, we would be wearing leather jackets year-round — and even some denim jackets with the right adjustments. That’s why we shop for versatile pieces that we don’t have to store away once the weather gets colder or warmer, and Amazon reviewers claim that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this utility jacket from WenVen</a> effortlessly falls into that category!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WenVen-Womens-Anork-Military-Style-Jacket.png><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WenVen Women’s Anork Military Style Jacket</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a> at Amazon! <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 31, 2022, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">military-inspired jacket</a> is a lightweight piece with a clean and sleek design. Even though it’s lighter than most coats we rock in the winter months, shoppers say that there’s enough room for you to layer thicker sweaters underneath if you’re gearing up for a bitter chill. The coat has a longer length, similar to a parka, with a zip closure and added button clasps to keep you warm. It also comes with a hood that you can detach if it’s balmy outside or you prefer your knit cap!</p><p>This is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">type of jacket</a> that you can wear with almost anything, whether you’re running errands or going out with friends on a Saturday night. Sure, we might not suggest styling it with a cocktail dress, but it’s a solid match for any other ensemble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WenVen-Womens-Anork-Military-Style-Jacket-2.png><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WenVen Women’s Anork Military Style Jacket</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a> at Amazon! <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 31, 2022, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>If you want to nail the full military-inspired vibe, go for the army green shade — but you can also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pick up this jacket</a> in a variety of statement-making colors.
