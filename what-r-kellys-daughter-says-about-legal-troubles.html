Kelly's Daughter?</h2><p>Around the time that R. Kelly's ex-wife accused him of violence, his daughter was rushed to the hospital. It later turned out that <a href=#>Buku had, unfortunately, suffered a miscarriage</a>.</p><p>So her trauma was seemingly unrelated to her dad's issues. But that doesn't mean Buku isn't privy to what's been going on with her father, or that she doesn't have strong feelings about the matter.</p><h2 id=does-r-kelly-39-s-daughter-think-he-39-s-innocent>Does R. Kelly's Daughter Think He's Innocent?</h2><p>A few years ago, Buku posted a long and detailed explanation to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram stories</a> that covered every facet of her father's case. Because R. Kelly's troubles began when his daughter was still young, Buku has clearly been in the trenches for quite some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The musician explained that she does not have a relationship with her father, but that it didn't stop people from harassing her and her family. Buku described her father's "life decisions and his last name" as more of a curse than any kind of blessing.</p><p>Buku declared that she and her mom (as well as her two siblings) "would never condone, support or be a part of ANYTHING negative" that Kelly has done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems sad that Buku would have to declare such a thing, but she elaborated that people have fabricated lies about her family in an effort to drag her father for his wrongdoings.</p><p>It's not fair, Buku noted, especially because it reminds her of "how terrible my father is" but that she can't do anything about it, nor "allow a safe space for other victims who are scared to speak up, speak up."</p><h2 id=does-r-kelly-39-s-daughter-still-talk-to-him>Does R. Kelly's Daughter Still Talk To Him?</h2><p>Buku made it quite clear years ago that she doesn't speak to her father anymore. And she began to pull away from him in childhood, she explained in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, when she began hearing her classmates in elementary school say negative things about his reputation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is How Disgraced Rapper R. Kelly Lost His $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Those experiences, the juxtaposition of her father as a nice family man versus a predator, caused Buku to feel suicidal in her younger years. At the same time, that was the period in which she discovered that performing was therapeutic to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So in spite of herself, Buku turned to the music industry just like her father had. Though she noted it wasn't easy, especially because people judged her based on their ideas about her dad. And yet Buku acquiesces, "There’s a lot about him as an artist that inspires me."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Surprising Facts About R.
