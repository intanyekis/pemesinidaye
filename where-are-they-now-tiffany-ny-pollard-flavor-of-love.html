These shows can run the gamut of topics from love on <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, to partying and a little bit of chaos on <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the 2000s, <a href=#>Flavor of Love</a> became a hit dating show that ultimately launched the career of Tiffany Pollard, who most people know better as New York. After getting her start on the famed dating show, Pollard was able to forge a career in entertainment by never shying away from being herself.</p><p>So, what has Tiffany Pollard been up to? Let's take a closer look and find out.</p><h2 id=she-rose-to-fame-on-39-flavor-of-love-39>She Rose To Fame On 'Flavor Of Love'</h2><p>On Flavor of Love, the then-unknown Pollard was given the nickname New York, which is how many people have come to know her over the years. Despite the change in name, there is a stark difference between New York and Tiffany.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm a diamond honey and there's so many facets to me. I say New York is my sassy side, my edgy, punched up self if you will. Tiffany is a little bit more cooler. I'm a nerd. I'm a tomboy. I sit at home and watch black and white movies," said Pollard.</p><p>Pollard proved to be the perfect fit for reality television, and in no time at all, she became one of the most talked-about people on the show. Thanks to one of the most infamous moments in reality television history taking place during that season, Pollard was guaranteed to be around for the long haul.</p><p>Now, some might question the reality aspect of reality television, but Pollard insists that she keeps it real.</p><p>"Everything I did was real, everything I do is real," Pollard told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a>.</p><p>After two seasons of Flavor of Love, fans were ready to see Pollard venture out on her own, so VH1 hooked her up with her own show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Shailene Woodley's Sister From 'Secret Life Of The American Teenager'?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-starred-on-her-own-show-called-39-i-love-new-york-39>She Starred On Her Own Show Called 'I Love New York'</h2><p>Debuting back in 2007 and lasting for two seasons, I Love New York was Pollard's chance to shine on the small screen on her own dating show. She made waves while chasing Flavor Flav, but this time around, she was the eligible bachelorette who was having to wade through a pool of suitors.</p><p>While it was not as memorable as Flavor of Love, I Love New York was still a success for VH1, and it kept Pollard in the limelight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When speaking about her time on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her own show</a>, Pollard said, "When I did I Love New York and I was now in the driver’s seat. It felt so good. I was the bomb. I had to make tough decisions as far as eliminations go, but I could breathe and really look for love and just have space to do it without fighting all the time.”</p><p>For the most part, people who participate on a reality show will simply fade into the background and just become another footnote in history, but unlike the majority, Pollard has actually done an exceptional job with building a viable career for herself in entertainment ever since breaking out on Flavor of Love.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To 'Sin City' Actor Nick Stahl?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-39-s-done-tons-of-television-work>She's Done Tons Of Television Work</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her own dating show helped make her a mainstay on television, Tiffany Pollard continued to land plenty of work on the small screen. While she was not regularly banking acting credits, she was still making appearances as herself, which is what people always wanted to see more of.</p><p>Pollard was able to snag a few more solo shows for herself through the years. She would star on New York Goes to Hollywood and New York Goes to Work, with each lasting for just a single season on the small screen.</p><p>Some of the other notable shows that Pollard has appeared on include Nip/Tuck, Botched, Steve Harvey, Celebrity Big Brother, Hip Hop Squares, The Real, Celebrity Ex on the Beach, and The Eric Andre Show. Again, she typically makes appearances as herself, aside from a few acting credits in projects like Sharknado 5.</p><p>According to IMDb, Pollard will be acting in a project called The Shaw, which is set for release next year. No word on how large of a role that she is going to have in the project, but it is still cool for fans to see her mix things up and add a little more acting to her overall list of credits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To 'The Mickey Mouse Club' That Made Britney Spears Famous?</a></span></p><p>Flavor of Love made Tiffany Pollard a household name, and she has made the most of her time in entertainment.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Erin Sanders, AKA Quinn, From 'Zoey 101'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqivsRmq6GdqWK7sMOMraCfnpGjxm662GanqKSclr%2BlecWlmK%2BnomK8p3nLqK2eZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
