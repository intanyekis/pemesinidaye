Everything will be happening as soon as possible, as soon as we get all the architects involved, engineers. It’s a few things we got to put in place—permits and stuff like that. Once all that gets in place, then we’ll start building up.”</p><p>Williams also spoke on Young Thug’s dedication to his hometown and how Slime City will reflect that. “He’s got things that he wants to do with the community,” explained the realtor. “Since I’ve known him, he’s been a giving person, he loves the community. I’ve never seen him turn down one person asking for a picture. So he’s going to build some stuff for the kids there.”</p><p>According to WSB-TV, Slime City will be located in the rural Atlanta area. Young Thug’s <a href=#>new album</a>, Punk, is due to drop this fall.
